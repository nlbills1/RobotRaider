        /* We apply the launcher rotation to the angular velocity we want to get the baked good rotating towards the
        target.   We do this with the code below, which isn't intuitively obvious.  Our rationale for the code:
         
         First we take the angle of rotation that is the launcher's angle of rotation and
         make that the direction of the throw, since that is what it is.
         Next we assume that that direction is the hypotenuse of a right triangle
         where the angle is that angle of direction and the hypotenuse is just 1.  Then if phi is that angle,
         we have:
         
         sin(phi) = x/1
         cos(phi) = z/1
         
         We use the z axis as our x axis and the x axis as our z axis, which would
         be in line for the coordinate system in SceneKit and how things start out.
         
         Now in our thinking since phi is the direction of the throw/launch, then
         90 degrees + phi would be the axis perpendicular to the direction of the throw.
         If we let theta be 90 degrees + phi, then:
         
         sin(theta) = x/1 = the amount of angular velocity we would apply around the x axis = avX
         cos(theta) = z/1 = the amount of angular velocity we would apply around the z axis = avZ
         
         And then if we have a speed s we want to apply, like pi/2.0, then
         
         angularVelocityAroundXAxis = avX * s
         angularVelocityAroundZAxis = avZ * s
         
         And it looks like we were close.  It appears that we have to take into account the
         direction of the robot because that also influences the direction of the launcher rotation and
         apply pi/2 if going North, 3*pi/2 if going south, nothing if going east and pi if going west.
         
         This seems to work:
