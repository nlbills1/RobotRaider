        // track of where to place something in different sized screens.  For the loc3D this isn't a problem as the 3D world
        // is a virtual world and the scene gets translated automatically to the 2D screen without our needing to do any
        // sort of compensating for screen size.  Also note that while UIKit uses a coordinate system where x=0,y=0 is the top
        // left corner of the screen, SpriteKit uses a coordinate system where x=0,y=0 is the bottom left corner of the screen.
        // Why they're different, I have no idea.  The coordinates below are based on the SpriteKit coordinate system.  So
